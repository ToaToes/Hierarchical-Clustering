# Hierarchical-Clustering
This is an implementation of generic Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm as described
in this webpage:
http://home.dei.polimi.it/matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/hierarchical.html
This is a Hierarchical Clustering with a constant "threshold" that indicate
the maximal distance between two clusters to group them. The algorithm stops
when no cluster can be merged. 
The distance between two clusters is calculated as the distance between the
medians of the two clusters.
