# Hierarchical-Clustering
<br />This is an implementation of generic Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm as described
<br />in this webpage:
```
http://home.dei.polimi.it/matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/hierarchical.html
```
<br />This is a Hierarchical Clustering with a constant "threshold" that indicate
<br />the maximal distance between two clusters to group them. The algorithm stops
<br />when no cluster can be merged. 
<br />The distance between two clusters is calculated as the distance between the
<br />medians of the two clusters.
